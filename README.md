# Numerical-Analysis

The primary goal of this repository is to explore some algorithms for solving science and engineering problems. A fundamental understanding of calculus, linear algebra and computer science principles is recommended. 

The topics included are:

Chebyshev Polnomials, 
Romberg, Adaptive and Gaussian Quadrature.
Euler's Method for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations
The Hodgkin-Huxely Neuron
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge
The Wave Equation
Monte Carlo Simulation
Stochastic Differential Equations
Fourier Transform and Signal Processing
Eigen Values and Singular Values
Optimization (Gradient Search)

Each folder should have its own README.md with some basic instructions as to how to use the code and a brief explanation of the mathematics in it.
